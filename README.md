# PBCore-Cataloging-Tool

First Commit - 12/6/2017
This version runs tests. (17 of them.)   If you run the applicaiton it doesn't do more than show the splash screen.

You should be able to run it through Netbeans or build it using Maven.
To run you need the lates Java JVM installed.  And  Maven or NetBeans installed.

To actually run the app 
just go into that subfolder and run “java -jar PBCore-Cataloging-Tool-1.0.jar” 
(assuming that was the jarfile generated by Maven - otherwise replace accordingly).
